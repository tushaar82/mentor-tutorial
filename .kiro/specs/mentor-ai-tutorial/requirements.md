# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a 7-day LLM-powered implementation guide for the Mentor AI EdTech platform. The guide enables two developers (Tushar - Backend, Vaishnavi - Frontend) to build the complete platform where 90% of code is generated by LLMs (ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot). Developers will only paste prompts into LLMs, copy-paste generated code, configure external services, and test functionality. The guide is structured with separate folders for each developer to enable simultaneous work.
