## Introduction

Mentor AI is a personalized EdTech platform designed to democratize access to world-class competitive exam preparation and eliminate the need for expensive coaching classes. **The platform's mission is to help families save lakhs of rupees in coaching fees by providing comprehensive, AI-powered preparation for JEE Main, JEE Advanced, NEET, and MHT CET that enables parents to guide their children at home.**

The MVP supports four major competitive exams: **JEE Main** (engineering entrance), **JEE Advanced** (IIT entrance), **NEET** (medical entrance), and **MHT CET** (Maharashtra Common Entrance Test for engineering and pharmacy). The platform provides students with AI-powered diagnostic testing, personalized study plans, adaptive practice modules, AI-generated visual mindmaps, and topic summaries. **All questions on the platform are AI-generated using Large Language Models (LLMs), grounded in the official exam syllabi stored in a vector database.** The platform includes a dedicated parent dashboard that provides learning schedules, progress tracking, and guidance resources to help parents support their children's preparation journey without expensive coaching. **The entire platform is multi-lingual**, supporting English, Hindi, and regional languages to ensure accessibility across India.

The platform aims to identify individual learning gaps and deliver targeted, syllabus-aligned practice content that helps students master weak areas efficiently while ensuring all content strictly follows the current exam system and patterns.
