# Day 5: Analytics Visualization (Frontend)

## What You're Building

Interactive analytics dashboard with charts, graphs, and performance insights that visualize diagnostic test results. This displays AI-generated analytics from the backend, showing student strengths, weaknesses, topic-wise performance, and personalized recommendations.

## Why This Matters

Analytics visualization transforms raw test data into actionable insights:
- **Visual Understanding**: Charts and graphs make complex data easy to understand
- **Strength Recognition**: Highlights topics where student excels
- **Weakness Identification**: Pinpoints areas needing improvement with visual emphasis
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows performance across subjects and topics
- **Motivation**: Visual progress encourages continued learning
- **Parent Communication**: Provides clear insights for parents to understand child's performance
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Helps students prioritize study topics based on visual data

A well-designed analytics dashboard helps students and parents quickly understand test performance and make informed decisions about study priorities.

## How It Works

**Analytics Visualization Flow:**

1. **Data Fetching**:
   - Fetch analytics from backend API after test submission
   - Analytics generated by Gemini Flash AI
   - Includes: overall score, subject-wise breakdown, topic-wise performance, strengths, weaknesses, recommendations
   - Display loading state while fetching

2. **Overall Performance Section**:
   - Large score display (e.g., "145/200" or "72.5%")
   - Score interpretation (Excellent, Good, Average, Needs Improvement)
   - Percentile rank (if available)
   - Time taken vs. allocated time
   - Visual score gauge/progress bar

3. **Subject-Wise Performance**:
   - Bar chart showing score in each subject (Physics, Chemistry, Math)
   - Percentage for each subject
   - Color coding: Green (>75%), Yellow (50-75%), Red (<50%)
   - Comparison with average scores
   - Hover to see detailed breakdown

4. **Topic-Wise Performance**:
   - Horizontal bar chart for all topics
   - Sort by: Score (ascending/descending), Weightage, Alphabetical
   - Color coding by performance level
   - Show marks obtained vs. total marks
   - Identify high-weightage weak topics (priority areas)

5. **Strengths and Weaknesses**:
   - Two-column layout
   - Strengths: Topics with >75% score (green badges)
   - Weaknesses: Topics with <50% score (red badges)
   - Show topic name, score, and weightage
   - Highlight high-weightage weaknesses

6. **Question Pattern Analysis**:
   - Pie chart showing correct, incorrect, unanswered distribution
   - Difficulty-wise performance (easy, medium, hard)
   - Time spent per question analysis
   - Negative marking impact

7. **AI Recommendations**:
   - Personalized study recommendations from Gemini
   - Priority topics to focus on
   - Suggested study approach
   - Estimated time to improve
   - Next steps

8. **Action Buttons**:
   - "Generate Study Schedule" (navigate to schedule page)
   - "Practice Weak Topics" (navigate to practice module)
   - "Download Report" (PDF export)
   - "Share with Parent" (email/share functionality)

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (React framework with App Router)
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Recharts (charting library for React)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- React-to-PDF (PDF export)
