# Task: Schedule Display UI

## What You're Building

An interactive schedule display interface that shows students their personalized AI-generated study plan. The interface includes a calendar view, daily task breakdown, progress tracking, and the ability to mark tasks as complete. This component visualizes the schedule generated by Tushar's backend (Day 8) and allows students to track their learning journey.

## Why This Matters

After receiving their diagnostic test analytics, students need a clear, actionable study plan. The schedule display:
- **Visualizes the learning path**: Shows day-by-day tasks in an easy-to-understand format
- **Tracks progress**: Allows students to mark tasks complete and see their advancement
- **Maintains motivation**: Visual progress indicators keep students engaged
- **Adapts to reality**: Shows which tasks are pending, completed, or missed
- **Provides structure**: Breaks down the overwhelming exam preparation into manageable daily tasks

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

```
Schedule Display Flow:
1. Fetch schedule from backend API
2. Parse schedule data (daily tasks, topics, durations)
3. Display in calendar view (monthly/weekly)
4. Show daily task breakdown for selected date
5. Allow task completion marking
6. Update progress indicators
7. Sync completion status with backend
```

### Key Components

1. **Calendar Component**
   - Monthly/weekly view of study schedule
   - Color-coded days (completed, in-progress, pending, missed)
   - Date selection for detailed view
   - Visual indicators for task density

2. **Daily Task List**
   - Shows all tasks for selected date
   - Task details: topic, duration, type (study/practice/revision)
   - Completion checkboxes
   - Priority indicators

3. **Progress Tracker**
   - Overall completion percentage
   - Days completed vs. total days
   - Topics mastered count
   - Study hours logged

4. **Task Details Panel**
   - Expanded view of selected task
   - Learning objectives
   - Resources (notes, practice questions)
   - Time tracking

### Data Flow

```
Backend API → Schedule Data → Calendar View
                            ↓
                    Daily Task List → Task Completion
                            ↓
                    Progress Update → Backend Sync
```

### Schedule Data Structure

```typescript
interface Schedule {
  student_id: string;
  exam_date: string;
  total_days: number;
  daily_tasks: DailyTask[];
  overall_progress: number;
}

interface DailyTask {
  date: string;
  day_number: number;
  tasks: Task[];
  total_duration: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'missed';
}

interface Task {
  task_id: string;
  topic: string;
  subject: string;
  type: 'study' | 'practice' | 'revision';
  duration: number; // minutes
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  completed: boolean;
  resources: string[];
}
```

## Learning Objectives

By completing this task, you will:

- Learn to display complex schedule data in user-friendly formats
- Implement progress tracking and state management
- Create interactive UI components with real-time updates
- Handle date manipulation and formatting
- Build responsive calendar interfaces
- Implement task completion workflows

## Time Estimate

- LLM Code Generation: 45 minutes
- Configuration: 30 minutes
- Testing: 30 minutes
- Total: 1.5-2 hours

## Prerequisites

- Completed: Day 5 - Analytics Visualization
- Installed: Node.js, npm, React development environment
